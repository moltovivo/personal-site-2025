      <h1>Aaron Mulvihill</h1>
      <p class="tagline">Finance Professional & Podcast Host</p>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Aaron Mulvihill. Today I'm an <a href="https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/bios/aaron-mulvihill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investment strategist</a>, which means I develop insights into markets and the economy, to help investors make more informed decisions. My focus is alternative investments, which is anything other than stocks & bonds. That can include real assets, like data centers, real estate, and the infrastructure behind the power grid. I also cover private equity, private credit, hedge funds and other assets. Most of my work is with clients, but you can also hear me chat with investors on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwl4mVAzABocOsNzH9Ywbf-XBP1GAqFSY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My background is in operations, finance and M&A across the infrastructure space. I spent 12 years with <a href="https://www.crh.com/who-we-are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRH</a>, the world's largest diversified building solutions provider. I managed factories, held various financial leadership roles, and worked on M&A to grow the business. I enjoyed helping to bring projects to life, which included building bridges, data centers, and lot of underground infrastructure for water, energy, and communications. That work allowed me to spend time in many countries, especially in Eastern Europe, the Netherlands and Australia and throughout the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        I regularly advise and collaborate with a number of early-stage founders where I can lend my expertise. Reach out to me if you'd like to work together.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up in Ireland but now live in New York. I have enjoyed tech and <a href="https://github.com/moltovivo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coding</a> all my life, and am usually working on projects for my own enjoyment, or to benefit my community. Most recently, I built an <a href="https://astoriaevents.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">events website for Astoria NY</a>, that uses AI agents to find all the things happening in the neighborhood.
